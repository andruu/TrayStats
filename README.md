  <b>Real-time system monitoring in your tray.</b>
</p>

TrayStats is a lightweight Windows app that puts live CPU, GPU, RAM, disk, network, battery, and more in your system tray. It shows a dynamic live-updating icon and pops up a rich dashboard when clicked -- no need to open Task Manager just to see how your system is doing.

This project was vibecoded by a developer who missed having quick system stats without opening Task Manager every five seconds.

|---|---|
| **Top Consumer** | Name of the process using the most CPU |
| **Process List** | Top 5 processes ranked by CPU usage, showing CPU % and memory in MB |

Updates every 3 seconds. Processes are grouped by name (e.g., multiple Chrome instances are combined).

### CPU

| Stat | Description |
|---|---|
| **Total Load** | Overall CPU utilization percentage |
| **Per-Core Bars** | Individual usage bars for each core (P-cores and E-cores) |

## Tray Icon Options

### Tray Metric

Choose which metric the tray icon displays:

| Option | Icon Shows |
|---|---|
| **CPU** | CPU total load percentage |
| **GPU** | GPU core load percentage |
| **RAM** | Memory load percentage |

### Icon Style

Choose the visual style of the tray icon:

| Style | Description |
|---|---|
| **Bar** | Vertical fill bar -- higher usage = taller bar. Green/yellow/red color coding |
| **Percentage** | Numeric percentage text rendered directly on the icon |
| **Mini Chart** | Rolling 16-sample bar chart showing recent history |

All styles use color coding: **green** (< 60%), **yellow** (60-85%), **red** (> 85%).

---

## Section Visibility

Right-click the tray icon and open the **Sections** submenu to toggle which sections appear on the dashboard. All sections are enabled by default. Available toggles:

- Weather
- Top Processes
- CPU
- GPU
- RAM
- Disk
- Battery
- Bluetooth
- Network
- System Uptime

---

## Running as Admin

Some hardware sensors (CPU temperature, disk temperature, GPU fan speed) require administrator privileges to read. Without admin:

- These values will show **N/A** in the dashboard
- Everything else (load percentages, memory, disk space, network) works normally

To get full sensor data:

1. Right-click the tray icon
2. Click **Restart as Admin**
3. Accept the UAC prompt

The app seamlessly restarts itself with elevated privileges. Your dashboard state and settings are preserved.

> **Note:** Some very new CPUs (e.g., Intel Arrow Lake / Core Ultra 200 series) may show N/A for temperature, clock, and power even with admin access. This is a known limitation of the underlying hardware monitoring library ([LibreHardwareMonitor](https://github.com/LibreHardwareMonitor/LibreHardwareMonitor)) which hasn't added full support for these processors yet. WMI fallbacks are used where available.

## Known Limitations

| Limitation | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Intel Arrow Lake** | Core Ultra 200 series CPUs have incomplete sensor support in LibreHardwareMonitor. Temperature, clock, and power may show N/A even with admin. WMI fallbacks provide partial data |
| **Laptop GPU fans** | Modern NVIDIA laptop GPUs stop fans at idle. Fan speed showing 0 RPM / N/A at low temps is expected behavior |
| **Admin required for full data** | Some sensors need elevated privileges. Use "Restart as Admin" from the tray menu |
| **Single monitor positioning** | The dashboard popup positions relative to the primary taskbar. Multi-monitor setups with taskbars on secondary displays may need manual adjustment |
| **Bluetooth scan interval** | Bluetooth device status updates every 15 seconds; very brief connections may be missed between scans |
