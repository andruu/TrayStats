# DXVK configuration for TrayStats
# Replaces system d3d9.dll with Vulkan-based implementation to prevent
# NVIDIA Advanced Optimus from blocking display mode switching (WPF bug).
# See: https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/9286

# Hide NVIDIA GPU from DXVK so the Vulkan device is created on the
# integrated GPU only -- zero NVIDIA handles held.
dxvk.hideNvidiaGpu = True

# Report shader model 1 so WPF falls back to software rendering.
d3d9.shaderModel = 1
